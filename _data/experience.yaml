    description: During this period, I embarked on a comprehensive investigation into the impact of artificial light on color appearance. The focal point of this study was to unravel the ways in which artificial lighting sources influence color perception. My research involved conducting a series of meticulous experiments aimed at measuring the levels of artificial light present in a corridor, as well as evaluating how natural light contributes to its distribution and, consequently, its perceived appearance. A thorough analysis was undertaken to quantify the effects of various light sources on color perception. This was essential in understanding the intricate relationship between artificial and natural lighting and their combined impact on how colors are viewed. The insights garnered from this research extend beyond the realm of interior design, shedding light on the potential health implications of artificial lighting.

    description: I volunteered at a charity shop dedicated to collecting and selling second-hand clothing. The proceeds from these sales were allocated to support elderly individuals. This endeavor not only provided an opportunity to contribute to a sustainable cycle of clothing reuse but also allowed me to directly impact the well-being of the senior community. Through this experience, I gained valuable insights into the operational aspects of nonprofit retail management, as well as a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by the elderly population.  My involvement in this charitable initiative reaffirmed my commitment to social responsibility and community service.
