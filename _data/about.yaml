# about me
first-paragraph:  I'm a Spanish student who has completed a master's degree in Extended Reality, with a rich academic background in mathematics from Edinburgh, Scotland. The master has taken me across diverse cultures in Joensuu, Gent, and Toyohashi, enriching my understanding of societal needs across geographical and cultural boundaries.



second-paragraph:  Driven by a deep-rooted belief in the power of science blended with cultural insights, I am passionate about developing technological solutions that address complex societal challenges. Through my unique international experiences, I've gained a perspective that values global cooperation and learning. My goal is to harness this knowledge to create innovations that enhance our quality of life, making our world more connected and responsive to its people's needs.




research-interest: Traditionally linked to gaming, XR’s potential in education, healthcare, and architecture is now widely acknowledged. My master’s thesis explores the intersection of neuroscience, psychology, and XR, aiming to deepen our understanding of human behavior through innovative technology. By merging technology with insights from social sciences, I aim to enhance learning environments, medical training, and architectural design. My ultimate goal is to use this synergy to improve quality of life and foster societal advancement, demonstrating XR’s role in shaping a more informed and efficient future.
