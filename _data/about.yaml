# about me
first-paragraph: Hello! I am a Spanish student finishing my master's degree in Extended Reality. My academic journey has been deeply rooted in the sciences, starting my undergraduate studies in mathematics unfolded in the historic and culturally rich city of Edinburgh, Scotland. However, I have been always interested in serving society. This XR master has given me knowledge in how to apply technoogy into social services. In addition, it has given me an international experience, as my master’s degree took me on an even more diverse and enlightening academic voyage across Joensuu in Finland, Gent in Belgium, and Toyohashi in Japan. This unique educational path has endowed me with an invaluable set of skills and perspectives. Immersing myself in such varied cultures has not only broadened my worldview but has also sharpened my ability to identify societal needs that transcend geographic and cultural boundaries. Through observing the strengths and areas for improvement in these different societies, I’ve gained insights into how we can learn from each other to foster a better global community.

second-paragraph: My scientific background, enriched by this tapestry of cultural experiences, positions me uniquely to contribute to enhancing our quality of life. I believe that the intersection of science with an acute awareness of societal needs and cultural nuances is where impactful innovations are born. My ambition is to apply the skills and knowledge I have acquired to develop solutions that simplify complex problems, making our lives easier and more connected. In this way, I aim to contribute to a future where technology and social insights work hand in hand to address the challenges we face, inspired by lessons learned from around the globe.




research-interest: Building upon my solid foundation in the sciences and propelled by a profound interest in the tangible benefits of social sciences, I embarked on an interdisciplinary journey following my degree in mathematics. This path led me to the realm of Extended Reality (XR), a domain traditionally associated with video games but now increasingly recognized for its potential in educational and social applications. My conviction in the transformative power of merging technology with social sciences motivates me to contribute to societal advancement through this nexus. In pursuit of this goal, I chose to focus my master's thesis on the interplay between neuroscience, psychology, and virtual reality. This interdisciplinary approach aims to unveil deeper insights into human behavior and judgment, leveraging XR as a tool for exploration. I am convinced that the uncharted territories of brain science present vast opportunities for discovery, particularly with the aid of technological innovations. Furthermore, the utility of XR extends beyond the study of human behavior. Its application across various fields such as education, medicine, and architecture demonstrates its capacity to enhance learning, improve medical training, and aid in the design process, thereby minimizing errors and enhancing outcomes. My ambition is to exploit the synergy between technology and social science, not only to expand our understanding of human cognition and behavior but also to devise innovative solutions that tackle contemporary challenges. By integrating technological advancements into social contexts, I am committed to driving significant improvements in quality of life and fostering a more prosperous future for our society.
