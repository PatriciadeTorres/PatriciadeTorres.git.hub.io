# about me
first-paragraph:  I'm a Spanish student on the verge of completing a master's degree in Extended Reality, with a rich academic background in mathematics from Edinburgh, Scotland. My studies have taken me across diverse cultures in Joensuu, Gent, and Toyohashi, enriching my understanding of societal needs across geographical and cultural boundaries.



second-paragraph:  Driven by a deep-rooted belief in the power of science blended with cultural insights, I am passionate about developing technological solutions that address complex societal challenges. Through my unique international experiences, I've gained a perspective that values global cooperation and learning. My goal is to harness this knowledge to create innovations that enhance our quality of life, making our world more connected and responsive to its people's needs.




research-interest: Building upon my solid foundation in the sciences and propelled by a profound interest in the tangible benefits of social sciences, I embarked on an interdisciplinary journey following my degree in mathematics. This path led me to the realm of Extended Reality (XR), a domain traditionally associated with video games but now increasingly recognized for its potential in educational and social applications. My conviction in the transformative power of merging technology with social sciences motivates me to contribute to societal advancement through this nexus. In pursuit of this goal, I chose to focus my master's thesis on the interplay between neuroscience, psychology, and virtual reality. This interdisciplinary approach aims to unveil deeper insights into human behavior and judgment, leveraging XR as a tool for exploration. I am convinced that the uncharted territories of brain science present vast opportunities for discovery, particularly with the aid of technological innovations. Furthermore, the utility of XR extends beyond the study of human behavior. Its application across various fields such as education, medicine, and architecture demonstrates its capacity to enhance learning, improve medical training, and aid in the design process, thereby minimizing errors and enhancing outcomes. My ambition is to exploit the synergy between technology and social science, not only to expand our understanding of human cognition and behavior but also to devise innovative solutions that tackle contemporary challenges. By integrating technological advancements into social contexts, I am committed to driving significant improvements in quality of life and fostering a more prosperous future for our society.
